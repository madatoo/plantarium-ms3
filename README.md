# Introduction

This is my third project for Code Institute. I am really glad that I got to work on it because it gave me an opportunity to show my passions, which are gardening and storing information about plants - the flowers, shrubs, and other plants I alredy have in my own backyard and those I would like to have in the future. This is why I decided to create a plants database for small gardens.

# User Experience (UX)

This was probably the hardest part of my project. To make this project useful for my visitors, I needed to create an ideal visitor's profile.

I assumed that this person would:

 - love gardening,
 - live in their own or rented house with a small garden or a few plant pots on the balcony.
 - be between 20 - 50 years old
 - have a small or intermediate experience in gardening
 - want to read a little about plants before they decide to buy them
 - would like to take care of the plants in a natural way (without chemical fertilisers)

## First time Visitor's needs:

- they would like to know what the page is about, this means that the main topic is described clearly 
- easy and intuitive navigate through out the webpage (divided into proper sections)
- to find plant descriptions, their needs, photos and some advice on how to take care of them
- know where to find important information for them (FAQ and navigation bar)
- how to create own account to save items, which they found interesting 


## Returning visitors are very often interested in:

- reading more interesting descriptions of plants
- creating their own plant book
- sharing saved descriptions and pictures with others users
- adding their own advices about taking care of the plants
- adding pictures and descriptions of plants they alredy have
- adding pictures and descriptions of plants they would like to have in the future
- sorting the plants by type (flowes/shrubs etc.)
- sorting plants by the options "I have the plant" or "I want the plant"
- editing saved plants
- adding pictures from own gardens to inspire others  

# Design

## Global 

## Color Scheme

The webpage have white background color, the pages and plants hedings on the page have darkgreen color to correspond nicely with the white background, whole paragraphs are written in black color to give a good contrast and give people a chance to read content easily. The navigation bar, footer and buttons on the page have a the same darkgreen background color to keep consistently design White text is added to incerease the users experience. 


## Typography

## Imagery

Imagery is very important for this page, and is used throughout, the website so that it's visually appealing. It helps visitors to remember flowers and easly identify them.

3. Update - from All Plants page visitors can go and read more about specific plant and edit all informations about plant.

 # Testing

 ## User Stories testing

 ### First Time Visitor Goals

 In this project FAQ wasen't implemented yet, but some informations about page functionallity were implemented. 
  - main purpose of the webpage is described on the Home page below the carusel,
  - how to add plant - each field in Add Plant form is described or intuitive (such us  switcher add to list wish field or plant place - you need only click on the correct place which have added icon, to help you decide about the correct place).
